# TASK Data Science & ML Collaborative Hub

Welcome to the **TASK** repository, a curated collection of data science 
solutions and problem-solving protocols developed by a team of four passionate 
learners. TASK (formed from our initials) represents our commitment to 
**T**ransparent, **A**ctionable, **S**ystematic, and **K**nowledge-driven 
approaches in data science.

## 📌 Mission
This repo serves a dual purpose:
- **For us**: Document our learning journey, establish reproducible workflows, 
  and build a shared knowledge base for solving DS, Viz, ML & DL challenges
- **For the community**: Provide beginner-friendly, real-world examples and 
  clear protocols that help aspiring data scientists start solving problems 
  immediately

## 📂 What You'll Find
- **`solutions/`**: Our team's code for various exercises and projects 
  (DS, ML, DL, Visualization)
- **`protocols/`**: Step-by-step guides covering:
  - Data exploration & preprocessing pipelines
  - ML model development lifecycle
  - DL experiment tracking best practices
  - Visualization storytelling principles
- **`resources/`**: Learning roadmaps, cheat sheets, and tool recommendations
- **`case-studies/`**: End-to-end project examples with detailed explanations

## 🚀 Getting Started
Each solution follows our TASK protocol: clear problem statement, reproducible 
code, visualization of results, and lessons learned. Perfect for self-study 
or team collaboration.

*Built by learners, for learners. Let's democratize data science, one 
problem at a time.*
